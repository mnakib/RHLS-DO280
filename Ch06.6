Outcomes

Manually delete unused images from the nodes.

Automate the image pruning by using a cron job.


0. Prepare the lab.

$ lab start appsec-prune && \
  oc login -u admin -p redhatocp \
  https://api.ocp4.example.com:6443 && \
  oc new-project appsec-prune && \
  cd ~/DO280/labs/appsec-prune


1. Start by manually cleaning up the unused container images in the node.

Remove the unused images in the node

$ oc get deployments -n prune-apps -o wide

$ oc debug node/master01
    # chroot /host 
    # crictl images | egrep '^IMAGE|httpd|nginx'
    # crictl rmi --prune

Delete the deployments that use the nginx images

$ oc delete deployment nginx-ubi{7,8,9} -n prune-apps



2. Create a cron job to automate the image pruning process.

Start by creating the ConfigMap

$ less ~/DO280/solutions/appsec-prune/configmap-prune.yaml

$ oc apply -f ~/DO280/solutions/appsec-prune/configmap-prune.yaml 


Create the image pruner resource

$ less ~/DO280/solutions/appsec-prune/cronjob-prune.yaml

$ oc apply -f ~/DO280/solutions/appsec-prune/cronjob-prune.yaml

$ watch oc get cronjobs,jobs,pods


If you try to get the pod logs, you'll get an error. That's because the pod is run with the default service account and you need to provide it with appropriate privileges.

$ oc logs pod/image-pruner-27950092-g76lb
Error from server (Forbidden): nodes is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:appsec-prune:default" cannot list resource "nodes" in API group "" at the cluster scope

$ oc delete cronjob/image-pruner

$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user -z default privileged

$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user \
  cluster-admin -z default

$ oc apply -f cronjob-prune.yaml

$ watch oc get cronjobs,jobs,pods

$ oc logs pod/image-pruner-27883660-2ghvv | tail



00. Clean up resources.

$ cd ~ && oc project && \
  oc delete cronjob/image-pruner configmap/maintenance && \
  oc adm policy remove-scc-from-user \
  -z default privileged \
  oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-user \
  cluster-admin -z default && \
  oc delete project appsec-prune prune-apps && \
  lab finish appsec-prune
